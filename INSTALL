ThinkFinger Installation Instructions
=====================================

This document describes how compile the ThinkFinger software.

Software Required For Compilation
=================================

The following software must be installed:

- the GCC compiler (http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/)
- libtool (http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/)
- pkg-config (http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org)
- the Linux-PAM, development files (http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/)
- libusb, development files, version >= 0.1.12 (http://libusb.sourceforge.net/)

To have access to the optional documentation, you also need:

- doxygen (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/)

Kernel Requirements
===================

In order to use the the PAM module pam_thinkfinger your Linux kernel has to be
compiled with uinput support (CONFIG_INPUT_UINPUT).  The location of the uinput
interface depends on your distribution.  To ensure that your system is properly
set up, one of the following interfaces have to exist:

  * /dev/input/uinput
  * /dev/misc/uinput
  * /dev/uinput

If the interface is not there, run:

  $ modprobe uinput

Ask your the maintainers of your distribution to automatically load the module.

Installation Steps
==================

Once the necessary software is installed, run:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make install

Note:  For a proper installation it is very likely that you have to use the
parameter '--with-securedir=$PAM_MODULES_DIR' when running 'configure'.
$PAM_MODULES_DIR is the directory where your PAM installation expects the
pluggable authentication modules.  It is convenient that this directory is
'/lib/security'.  Example:

  $ ./configure --with-securedir=/lib/security

When building with PAM support you might also want to adjust the parameter
'--with-birdir'.  The ThinkFinger PAM module uses this directory to look up the
biometric identification records (bir files).  Example:

  $ ./configure --with-birdir=/etc/pam_thinkfinger

Instructions For SVN
====================

If you are compiling from an SVN checkout, the first time you also need:

- autoconf, version >= 2.54 (http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/)
- automake, version >= 1.7.9 (http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/)

And before the './configure' script run:

  $ ./autogen.sh
